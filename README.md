<h1>The Dangers Of Social Engineering</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration]()

<h2>Description</h2>
For this project, I chose to research social engineering and the tools employed to carry out these attacks.For this instance, I chose the Social Engineering Toolkit (SET for short).Social engineering attacks constituted over 70% of all attacks in 2020.This emphasizes the importance of education on the subject.I will be demonstrating the sending of a phishing link to a victim containing a credential harvester using SET.
<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Social Engineering Toolkit(SET)</b> 
- <b>VirtualBox</b>
- <b>Hyperlinks</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Kali(Attacker)</b> 
- <b>Windows 10(Victim)</b>

<h2>Project Walkthrough</h2>
First, after choosing SET, i researched how to download and configure it on my attacker kali VM. Then i researched the tool itself and its capabilities and chose credential harvester as the method i will be demonstarting.
